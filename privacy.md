# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 2026**

KubeDesk is a Desktop Client for Kubernetes Cluster Management. This page describes how the KubeDesk website and application handle your information.

## 1. No Personal Data Collection

The KubeDesk website (hosted on GitHub Pages) does not collect, store, or process any personal data. We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or analytics scripts on this site beyond what GitHub Pages may passively collect as part of its hosting infrastructure.

## 2. GitHub Pages Hosting

This website is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). GitHub may collect standard server logs (IP addresses, browser type, referring URLs) as part of normal hosting operations. Please refer to [GitHub's Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) for details on their data practices.

## 3. KubeDesk Application

The KubeDesk desktop application connects **only** to Kubernetes clusters you configure explicitly. It does not:

- Send any data to our servers
- Collect telemetry or usage statistics
- Store credentials outside of your local machine
- Make network requests beyond your configured cluster endpoints

All cluster credentials and kubeconfig files remain on your local machine and are never transmitted outside of your direct cluster connections.

## 4. Third-Party Links

This website may contain links to GitHub and other third-party services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those external sites.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, updates will be reflected on this page. Continued use of the site or application after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## 6. Contact

For privacy-related questions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/akkezi/KubeDesk/issues) on GitHub.
